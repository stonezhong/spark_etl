Description: # Deployers
        ## HDFSDeployer
        **Deploy application build to HDFS via a bridge host**
        
        To create a deployer, here is the sample code:
        * `bridge` is a ssh hostname where you can run the `hdfs dfs ...` command
        * `stage_dir` is a temporary directory in `bridge` machine, for storing temporary files.
        ```
            deployer = HDFSDeployer({
                "bridge"   : "spnode1",
                "stage_dir": "/root/.stage_dir",
            })
        ```
        
        To deploy an application, here is the sample code:
        * Frist parameter tells where is the application `build`. You need to build to this directory first
        * Second parameter tell where is the destination to deploy the application.
        ```
            deployer.deploy(
                "/mnt/DATA_DISK/projects/spark_etl/examples/myapp/build", 
                "/apps/myjob"
            )
        ```
        
        # Job Submitters
        ## LivyJobSubmitters
        To create a job submitter, here is the sample code:
        * `service_url` points to the livy endpoint
        * `username`, `password` is your livy username and password
        * `bridge`: is a ssh hostname, where you can run `yarn logs -applicationId` to get the application log
        
        Here is an example:
        ```
            job_submitter = LivyJobSubmitter({
                "service_url": "http://10.0.0.11:60008/",
                "username": "root",
                "password": "foo",
                "bridge": "spnode1"
            })
        ```
        
        To run the application, here is the sample:
        * first parameter is the deployment location. The deployer is responsible for the deployment.
        * `/apps/myjob/build/1.0.0.1` resides  in HDFS
        ```
            job_submitter.run(
                "/apps/myjob/build/1.0.0.1"
            )
        ```
